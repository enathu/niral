NIRAL
=====

Niral is a responsive but simplest grid -- nothing fancy. 
And again this is not yet another grid, its yet another awesome grid that works well on all browsers. Sorry IE6.

I use this Niral grid for all my cool projects. And it uses that ```box-sizing: border-box``` thingy, you know. :) In this simplest responsive grid, you can add padding, borders or whatever you want, to any grids without having sky fall on your head. That's simple!

Well, you can say this is a painfully simplest responsive grid for your awesome projects.
