NIRAL
=====

Niral is a responsive but simplest grid -- nothing fancy. 
And again this is not yet another grid, its yet another awesome grid that works well on all browsers. Sorry IE6.

I use this Niral grid for all my cool projects. And it uses that ```box-sizing: border-box``` thingy, you know. :)

Well, you can say this is a painfully simplest responsive grid for your awesome projects.
